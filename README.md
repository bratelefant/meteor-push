Trying to get [activitree:meteor-push](https://github.com/activitree/meteor-push) running on meteor 2.5.1 (cf. README there) by moving from the archived cordova plugin [phonegap-plugin-push](https://github.com/activitree/meteor-push) to a fork [cordova-plugin-push](https://github.com/havesource/cordova-plugin-push). I'm trying to limit modifications as much as possible to hopefully not break anything.

If you are looking for the original README.md for this fork, cf [here](USEAGE.md).
